# 4LoopMiciti

Miciti
Our idea behind our application was to have details based on somebody visiting a new city. We wanted to provide the user with some knowledge of the location that they are visiting as a way to give users some peace of mind because it isn't easy to start in a new place. We categorized it into 4 topics which include: Transportation, Lodging, Spots, and of course Food. To access our application the user would need a username and password which can be created and deleted at the users discretion. The user would then be able to navigate to one of the 4 categories mentioned above from the main menu screen to find details about each one that also include buttons that takes to the user to the site of the specified topic(heb button would take you to heb.com (Note* the user would need internet access in order to go to the sites)). They could then go to the back to the main menu using the home button which they can then navigate to another category or sign out.
