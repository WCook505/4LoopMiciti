Our idea behind our application was to have details based on somebody visiting a new city. We wanted to provide the user with some knowledge of the location that they are visiting as a way to give users some peace of mind because it isn't easy to start in a new place. We categorized it into 4 topics which include: Transportation, Lodging, Spots, and of course Food. The user upon creating an account or signing in will gain access to information upon each topic and some ways to meet their needs. We implemented this idea for the city of San Antonio. To give an example lets say a person named Bill is moving to San Antonio for the summer for an internship. Bill is trying to determine where he can stay. By using our app Bill would be able to navigate to our lodging category and find out that Texas A&M offers 50 a day stay in their dormitory which is where his internship happens to be nearby.
